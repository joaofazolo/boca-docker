# Managing data in boca-docker

This demo shows how to persist data in a dockerized BOCA setup. Docker offers two options for containers to store files on the host machine, so that the files are persisted even after the container stops: _volumes_, and _bind mounts_. While bind mounts are dependent on the directory structure and OS of the host machine, volumes are completely managed by Docker.
Volumes are often the preferred mechanism for persisting data generated by and used by Docker containers. No matter which type of mount you choose to use, the data looks the same from within the container. For more information, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.docker.com/storage/).

## Example

* Launch the application:

**... via docker compose**

  ```sh
  docker compose -f tests/volumes/docker-compose.yml up -d
  ```

**... or docker stack deploy**

  ```sh
  docker stack deploy --compose-file tests/volumes/docker-compose.yml boca-stack-volume
  ```

* Open a web browser and visit the URL [http://localhost:8000/boca](http://localhost:8000/boca). To login use the default credentials (Name: _system_ | Password: _boca_);

* To bring it down:

**... via docker compose**

  ```sh
  docker compose -f tests/volumes/docker-compose.yml down
  ```

**... or docker stack rm**

  ```sh
  docker stack rm boca-stack-volume
  ```
