            # this optional variable can be used to define another location -
            # like a subdirectory - for the database files. The default is
            # /var/lib/postgresql/data. If the data volume you're using is a
            # filesystem mountpoint (like with GCE persistent disks) or remote
            # folder that cannot be chowned to the postgres user (like some 
            # NFS mounts), Postgres initdb recommends a subdirectory be created
            # to contain the data.
            - PGDATA=/var/lib/postgresql/data/pgdata
        volumes:
            # volume mount to container's fs

volumes:

    # example 1: when launching boca-docker for the first time Docker will 
    # create a named volume (boca-data). Onwards every time one brings the
    # application down and then rerun it `docker compose` will try to create
    # a volume named `boca-data` but it would notice that a volume with that
    # name already exists for this compose file. Then it will helpfully mount
    # the same volume again.
    boca-data:

    # example 2: conversely, one can create and manage a volume outside of the
    # docker-compose file. For that, it's necessary to create it first using 
    # the`docker volume create boca-data` command, declare it in the compose
    # file under volumes and set the property `external: true`. Then, when 
    # launching the application Docker will find out if the volume exists; but
    # if it doesn’t, an error will be reported.
    # boca-data:
    #     external: true
